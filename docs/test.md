# What you get and how to use SIMETRI

## Pick-of-the-Month Reports

Our **Pick of the Month** report is released once a month on the **second Tuesday of every month at 1pm Eastern Time.** They are crypto prospects that we believe possess strong fundamentals but also have the potential to generate explosive gains in the **short-term** (1-3 month horizon).

We believe these are worth investing in immediately upon report release.

We will provide a **“Buy up to Price”** in the “Quick Facts” section (first page) of the report. This price, in our opinion, is the highest price per coin that would still make the project an attractive investment.

Depending on market conditions, if we feel it may be time to take profits we will send you a sell alert. You can find recent trade alerts **[here](https://simetri.cryptobriefing.com/news/trade-alerts)**

These reports are good for both long-term holders as well as short term traders.

Pick of the Month reports fall in line with **[Crypto Investment Strategy: Part Two - Playing Venture Capitalist](https://simetri.cryptobriefing.com/crypto-investing-strategies-part-two-playing-venture-capitalist/)**.

We reserve the right to not release a pick if market conditions are not right for the month.

## Full Digital Asset Reports

These are in-depth analysis reports that assess the **long term** (one-year horizon) prospects of top coins and their respective investment rating.

We consider anything that gets a **B or higher an investable project for the long term.** These are coins that we believe are worth hanging onto for the long run.

In the “Quick Facts” section of the report (first page) you will find the **“Buy up to price”.** This price, in our opinion, is the highest price that would still make the coin an attractive investment.

Update reports and grade changes are provided when necessary - e.g. A major change to fundamentals like market opportunity, technology or ecosystem.

These reports are great for less active crypto traders looking for strong projects to hold onto.
